# retail-product-classifier
This end-to-end Deep Learning project automates retail inventory by identifying 18 grocery categories. Using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the system achieves high-accuracy classification. It bridges the gap between AI research and real-world use via an interactive Streamlit web app for seamless image recognition.
